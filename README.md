## Overview
QR Codes are generally either used digitally on websites and apps to make it easier for users to perform something or used in printing when marketing your products or company. By printing your company URL's QR Code on your business card, you eliminate the need for people to type in the website to see it.

In this project, I generated a QR code component using HTML and CSS. You can see the full code on this GitHub repository.
